# tweet_grabber
This project is an ongoing effort by the *Artificial Intelligence Initiative*, an organization at Texas Tech University.

The goal of this project is to gather sentiment analysis on tweets over a given topic and display it using interactive maps. Currently, the program only works for tweets written in English and maps the sentiment to United States counties, but further efforts will focus on incorporating other languages and map types.

(Note: An average sentiment near zero for a county has the same color as a county with no data, and will be fixed in future versions)*
